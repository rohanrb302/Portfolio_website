The project was a complete machine learning pipeline: data collection through web scrapping, cleaning the data, visualising the data to understand which model would work best, deploying and evaluating multiple machine learning algorithms such as random forest,naive bayes and logistic regression. Achieved an optimal accuracy of 88.88% using Python."
