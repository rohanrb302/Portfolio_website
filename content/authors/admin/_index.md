I am a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University at the Electrical and Computer Engineering department. My current interests lie at the intersection of scalable software development and machine learning. Most recently, I have worked with Prof.Giulia Fanti, Prof. Suma Bhat and Prof. Nicolas Christin to detect euphemisms across web forums. Prior to joining CMU, I had worked at EY as a software developer.
